# Implamentation-and-Some-Modification-about-DQN-and-SAC
In this project, I explore some typical value-based and policy-based RL algorithms. I do experiments on DQN and its six variants and their combination in Atari environments Pong and Boxing. I also do some experiments on SAC with DDPG as baseline on three MuJoCo environments Hopper-v2, Ant-v2, and HalfCheetah-v2.
